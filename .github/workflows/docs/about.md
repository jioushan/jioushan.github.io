# About AS134478 & AS199605
We have recently restructured our services. If you have followed us in the past, you have found that we basically use AS134478 worldwide. To be precise, I maintain it alone. If one day you find us disappearing from the online world, there is a high probability that something untoward has happened to ....

But we had to split the international services of AS134478 to AS199605 due to some policy adjustments so that we could adapt to the changing policy issues in the future and not worry about learning in some areas and exploring the feasibility of network technologies and thus violating some policy issues.

So AS199605 was born, we used the new configuration, and it will continue to be our international network for a long time; at least that's what I decided.

And AS134478 will slowly disappear, but that doesn't mean it's gone, just that I hope to be able to hide it to a large extent. But the fact is that it's still alive and well.

It is interesting to note that I am running two different and identical network backbones, even though they are both IPV6, largely because I don't have an IPv4 prefix. Unless some kind person supports me.

They are both part of the Jsmsr network.

Regarding the naming issue, I hope I can explain it properly here.

If you find the AS134478 called JSMSR yes the earliest we appeared in the network world, this is our original name, but I am a student and I want to learn to configure the network. So So the name Jsmsr Experimental Network was born, and technically that's what it means today. But I need to register a company to exist as AS199605.

I am willing to actively join various public interest IXs or VMs and let Jsmsr run on them and peer with them.

If there are good people who support me, feel free to buy me a cup of coffee by way of [PayPal.](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/jioushan)

You know where I can be reached and I look forward to hearing from you.
