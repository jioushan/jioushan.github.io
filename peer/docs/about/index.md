# JSMSR Network | About
## About AS12198 & AS401009

We have restructured our services.

Strictly speaking, We are still a one-man DevOps.
If one day you find us disappearing from the online world, there is a high probability that something untoward has happened to ....

But we had to split the international services of AS401009 to AS12198 due to some policy adjustments so that we could adapt to the changing policy issues in the future and not worry about learning in some areas and exploring the feasibility of network technologies and thus violating some policy issues.

So JSMSR Network was born, we used the new configuration, and it will continue to be our international network for a long time.
At least that's what I decided.

It is interesting to note that I am running two different and identical network backbones, even though they are both IPV6, They are both part of the JSMSR network.

we willing to actively join various public interest IXs or VMs and let JSMSR Network run on them and peer with them.

If there are good people who support me, feel free to buy me a cup of coffee by way of [PayPal.](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/jioushan)

You know where I can be reached and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best Wishes,
